<p><strong>Please note that the financial markets are very competitional. Therefore I had to remove several parts which would give away my edge in the market if made public.</strong></p>


This is my fully automated cryptotrading algorithm, a private long-term project which is currently profitable on BTC/USD and DOGE/USD. I showcase this project to display my understanding for modular python projects, as well as asynchronous programming, multiprocessing, usage of shared dictionaries while avoiding race conditions and deadlocks.
