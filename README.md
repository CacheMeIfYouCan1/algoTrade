This is a fully automated cryptotrading algorithm, a private long-term project which is currently profitably trading BTC/USD and DOGE/USD on the DYDX exchange. This project is showcased to display understanding for modular python projects, as well as websockets, asynchronous programming, multiprocessing and the usage of shared dictionaries while avoiding race conditions and deadlocks.
