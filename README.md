# algoTrade

This is my fully automated cryptotrading algorithm, currently profitable on BTC and DOGE. I showcase this project to display my understanding for modular python projects, as well as asynchronous programming, multiprocessing, usage of shared dictionaries while avoiding race conditions and deadlocks. 

Please note that the financial markets are very competitional. Therefore I had to remove several parts which would give away my edge in the market if made public.
